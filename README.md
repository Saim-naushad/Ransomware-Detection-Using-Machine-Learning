# Ransomware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

# Project Description
This project uses machine learning, specifically a neural network, to detect ransomware attacks by analyzing features in network traffic. With the increasing threat posed by ransomware attacks, it's crucial to have robust detection systems that identify malicious activity early on.
