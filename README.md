# Ransomware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning, specifically a neural network, to detect ransomware attacks by analyzing features in network traffic. With the increasing threat posed by ransomware attacks, it's crucial to have robust detection systems that identify malicious activity early on.

### Technologies used within the project
* TensorFlow/Keras was used for the model architecture and training because of its flexibility and efficiency in deep learning tasks.
* Pandas and Numpy were employed for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn were chosen for visualizing the performance metrics, confusion matrix, and dataset distribution.
